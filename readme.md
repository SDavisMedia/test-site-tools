## Test Site Tools

Just a simple plugin that makes it easier to manage test/demo sites. 

### Features

Check back frequently. Features will be built into the plugin based on my real life experiences.

#### Admin Toolbar

Links added to front-end site name menu:
* Plugins
* Tools > Import Content
* Tools > Regenerate Thumbnails (only if plugin is installed: [Regenerate Thumbnails](http://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/))

More features coming soon...

## Notes

If you have any suggestions, open a new issue. If you'd like to add to the plugin, fork it and submit a pull request. All contributions are welcome.
